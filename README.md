#ADS CITATIONS WEB SCRAPER

## Description

This is a simple scritp to scrap the NASA ADS site http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html for papers with a specific author/co-author. The script includes a small delay to avoid being blacklisted and it should not pose a high load on the ADS server. 

Since the new ADS interface already includes this functionality this code is only useful for very specific queries.
